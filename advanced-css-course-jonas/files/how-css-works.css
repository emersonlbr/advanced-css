    7 - 1 Pattern
      7 different folders for partial Sass files
        base/ - basic project definitions 
        componets/ - one file for each componet
        layout/ - over layout of the project
        pages/ - styles for specific pages of the project
        themes/ - if you want to implement different visual themes 
        abstracts/ - code that doesn't output any CSS, variables and Mixis 
        vendors/ - Where all 3rd party CSS files goes

How is CSS parsed ?

  The Cascade - process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflits between different CSS files
    Importance > specificity > source order

  
  CSS Values - Every CSS property has a value even if you haven't declared it

  How units are converted from relative from absolute (PX)
    the parent's width is the reference for percentaged based calculations

  EMs
    the reference is the parents computed font size
  
  REMs
    Use the root for font-size

  VH
    1 = view port size
  vw
    1 = view port width
